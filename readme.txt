-- Configuration --
config.ini is initially set to search the local computer for the server. To connect to someone else's server, you have to change its contents to the IP address of that person's server. Just change the IP address from 127.0.0.1 to the desired IP and everything should work fine. Also note, as the server, you must unblock port 5650 on your router (search Google on how to unblock a port for your specific router.)

-- Modifying the game files -- IMPORTANT
LOS is set to automatically unpack the data.los file every time it loads. This is so when you customize the game, you can just give people your data.los file and they will have all of your customizations!

*** BUT, note: Every time after you change a file in the data/ folder, you must run archive.exe so that it saves your changes in a new data.los file. Otherwise, you will lose your changes!

-- How to use the map editor (mapedit.exe) --
Arrow keys - pan around
Number keys - change the currently selected tile to this tile (0 through 9)
n - New map
s - Save map
c - New NPC
p - Set starting point of players to the currently selected point
t - Place a "special" non-numeric tile
e - Create enemy at current location
d - Delete enemy at current location
v - View entire map as a mini-map
   While in this map mode, you have some new commands at your disposal:
	g - Teleport to location
	c - Fill a whole area with a certain tile by dragging
	t - Randomly scatter a tile type onto an area by dragging (e.g. for trees)
	x - Exit minimap mode

Enjoy the game!
